### What is Discord.com exactly?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discord_(software)):
> Discord is a proprietary freeware VoIP application and digital distribution platform designed for creating communities ranging from gamers to education and businesses. Discord specializes in text, image, video and audio communication between users in a chat channel. Discord runs on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Linux, and in web browsers. As of 21 July 2019, there are over 250 million users of the software.

Or as I once heard from a critique:
> Discord is just IRC with extra features.

A _server_ in Discord simply refers to the community itself.

### What about Discord's poor privacy policy?

It has been raised many times about Discord's [awful privacy control](https://swordfishevaluations.com/2019/09/12/privacy-concerns-with-discord/), [being a potentional spyware](https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/discord.html), [Richar Stallman's blog](https://stallman.org/discord.html), and [risks of online predators](https://www.wsj.com/articles/discord-where-teens-rule-and-parents-fear-to-tread-11560245402) in a national newspaper. But as much as I'd like to hate Discord because of this, it is hard to deny the wonderful growing communities that are no less-productive than their counteparts in another privacy-focused platform. That alone encouraged me to create this list.

### How to stay safe in Discord?

Discord has a spiffy guide for you [staying safe in communities](https://discord.com/new/safety/360043857751-Four-steps-to-a-super-safe-account) and [for your teenage kids](https://discord.com/new/safety/360044153831-Helping-your-teen-stay-safe-on-Discord). Like any other platform Discord is often targeted for malicious attacks, but with a little caution you'll be safe as houses.

### How is this list any different from Discord listing sites?

You may have come around websites that are known for listing Discord communities for promotional and showcase purpose. This is not one of them. Each community here is hand-picked, reviewed by a maintainer, and meets [certain criteria](CONTRIBUTING.md#review-policy) e.g., activity vs. productivity ratio, technology-related only, has dedicated channels to help the members -- before they can be finally added; whereas the listing websites often require to link in-house bots that may collect server data and no review against possible unfriendly communities.

### Are you or is this project affiliated?

Neither me, or any part of this project is affiliated with Discord in any way.

### Why does not this list follow convential Awesome list framework?

This was intentional since the very first [commit](https://github.com/mhxion/awesome-discord-communities/commit/303990bcd36e4b10b4dfa80289c8303778d54f07). Unlike other listings in Awesome lists, Discord communities are much more diverese, asymmetrical, and miscellaneous. I.e., the community [Game Dev League](https://gamedevleague.com/) and [Game Dev Network](https://twitter.com/gamedevnetwork_) are both independent and prominent, neither of them offer only one type of support but rather any general support relating game development. That is why an one-liner description for both of them would seem very much vague to the users, the only difference that stands between them are their channels and spoken languages that they offer. And this is true for 53% of the total communities. But channels don't necessarily always explain "what this community is." This was the biggest challenge into making this list. Instead a description, to define a community along with its channels, languages, at the same time not making the list too condensed -- [badges](badges.md) were adapted, specially the [home badge](badges.md#home-badge) which is a link that takes you to the community-owned website. Other badges serve noteworthy purpose as well. Feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/mhxion/awesome-discord-communities/issues/new/choose) if a new submission doesn't fit within this structure.

### How to contribute?

Refer to the [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) page. As for now the pull request isn't automated.

### How to report any issue with the list?

If you have found a typo or maybe an invite link is invalid, you can open a new issue [here](https://github.com/mhxion/awesome-discord-communities/issues/new/choose), I'll try to fix it soon as possible.

### How to properly attribute to compliment the license (CC BY 4.0)?

I understand [CC-BY-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) isn't the best open-source license, the only restriction is it requires the user to attribute the owner. Simply mentioning the name `awesome-discord-communities` (even without the GitHub link) anywhere in a separate attribution page or on the same page where you used the list is enough and meets the proper validity in my eye.
